irrational? Here $\phi$ is the Euler totient function.

/--
Let $f$ assign rational values to residues modulo $2^k$, where $k \ge 1$.
The binary series with coefficients $f(\varphi(n) \bmod 2^k)$ is rational exactly
when $f$ has the same value on every even residue class. This is a solved
variant; the series with unreduced totients above remains open.
